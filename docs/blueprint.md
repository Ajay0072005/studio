# **App Name**: Unsolvable Slider

## Core Features:

- Grid Initialization: Create a 6x6 grid with numbers 1-35 and one empty tile, initialized in an unsolvable state using the inversion parity rule.
- Move Validation: Check if a clicked tile is adjacent to the empty tile before allowing a move.
- Tile Swapping: Swap the clicked tile with the empty tile, updating the grid.
- Grid Rendering: Display the grid of tiles with numbers and an empty space.
- Click Handling: Listen for click events on tiles to initiate move attempts.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for a cybernetic and energetic feel.
- Background color: Dark grey (#222222) to provide contrast and enhance the cyber theme (desaturated primary hue).
- Accent color: Neon green (#39FF14) to highlight interactive elements and reinforce the tech aesthetic.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of text, to evoke a computerized and techy feel. If longer text is anticipated, use this for headlines and 'Inter' for body.
- Use CSS Grid to create the 6x6 grid layout for the tiles.
- Subtle glow effects on the tiles to give them a cyberpunk edge.
